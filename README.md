My personal website showcasing projects, skills, and creative works. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it includes a homepage, portfolio, and contact info. Hosted on GitHub Pages for free online access, this project is a learning platform and personal portfolio to practice web development and experiment with new techniques.
